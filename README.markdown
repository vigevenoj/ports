These are some MacPorts Portfiles

Ports that I use on a regular basis:
*   amarok-devel
*   digikam
*   kdegraphics4 (for digikam)
*   kipi-plugins

Ports that I am holding at a specific version for now:
*   tcl
*   tk
*   loudmouth
*   qtscriptgenerator 

Ports that are probably broken right now:
*   phonon-vlc

Ports that build but have bugs unrelated to MacPorts
*   gcalcli (Has trouble with Unicode, but works otherwise, if passwords are properly escaped)
